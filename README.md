## What is it

I wanted to practice writing Go, and used to use <a href="https://github.com/jkwill87/mnamer">Mnamer</a>
for renaming all of my media. 

This project is based on that. There are still some things
that need to be done such as:

- [ ] Integrating with theTVDB for episodes
- [ ] Adding Charm options for selection
- [x] Reduce boilerplate by having it rename once even if more than one file

So far it works well on movies
